### Sentiment analysis systems help organizations gather insights into real-time customer sentiment, customer experience and brand reputation. Generally, these tools use text analytics to analyze online sources, such as emails, blog posts, online reviews, customer support tickets, news articles, survey responses, case studies, web chats, tweets, forums and comments. Algorithms are used to implement rule-based, automatic or hybrid methods of scoring whether the customer is expressing positive, negative words or neutral words.

Sentiment analysis can also extract the polarity or the amount of positivity and negativity, as well as the subject and opinion holder within the text. This approach is used to analyze various parts of text, such as a full document or a paragraph, sentence or subsentence.
